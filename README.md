# Java_program

Java program that goes into a loop and then (continuously) 
prompts the user for three values. The user is then asked if he/she 
would like to select the largest of the three values or the smallest of 
the three values. The program should then display the correct result, 
and prompt the user to go again or exit.

**Program**
- Checks for user's input (accepts only numbers).
- Finds smallest and largest number
- Veryfies user's input in case he/she would want to see the largest/smallest number
- Checks if all numbers are the same.
- Allows user to either continue or exit the program.
